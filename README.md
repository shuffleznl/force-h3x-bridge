# Pylontech H3X Bridge for Home Assistant

This repository contains the HACS-installable **Pylontech H3X Bridge** Home Assistant custom integration for a Pylontech Force H3X system.

| Integration | Domain | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pylontech H3X Bridge | `pylontech_h3x_bridge` | Local Modbus TCP bridge for Force H3X sensors and controls. |

Pylontech H3X Bridge exposes the H3X sensors and writable Modbus controls needed by Home Assistant automations and energy-management systems. The register map below follows the integration implementation and the manufacturer document **ModBus Protocol Pylon FH3X V1.2 (2025-08-11)**.

## What It Controls

Default entity IDs are based on a clean Pylontech H3X Bridge install:

| Purpose | Default entity |
| --- | --- |
| EMS mode | `select.pylontech_h3x_bridge_ems_mode` |
| Charge/discharge power | `number.pylontech_h3x_bridge_charge_discharge_power_ref` |
| Battery SOC | `sensor.pylontech_h3x_bridge_battery_soc` |
| House load | `sensor.pylontech_h3x_bridge_load_power` |
| Battery module count | `sensor.pylontech_h3x_bridge_battery_module_count` |
| Battery system capacity | `sensor.pylontech_h3x_bridge_battery_system_capacity` |
| Battery usable capacity | `sensor.pylontech_h3x_bridge_battery_usable_capacity` |
| BMS temperature | `sensor.pylontech_h3x_bridge_bms_temperature` |
| Charge SOC limit | `number.pylontech_h3x_bridge_charge_limit_soc` |
| Discharge SOC limit | `number.pylontech_h3x_bridge_discharge_limit_soc_eps` |

The H3X integration writes Modbus register `40907` for EMS mode and `40901` for the signed charge/discharge power reference. It must be in `User mode` while forcing charge or discharge.

## Modbus Entity And Register Map

The entity IDs below are the defaults for a clean installation. Home Assistant may append a suffix when an entity ID already exists, and user-renamed entity IDs are not changed back by the integration. Register addresses are shown exactly as they are placed in the Modbus TCP request; do not prepend `4` or apply a one-register offset when comparing them with integration logs.

All values are read with function `0x03` (Read Holding Registers). Single-register writes use `0x06`; contiguous and 32-bit writes use `0x10`. Multi-register values use high word first (big-endian word and byte order).

### Writable Controls (Slave 2)

| Default entity | Register(s), decimal (hex) | Raw type / scale | Allowed UI values and behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `number.pylontech_h3x_bridge_charge_discharge_power_ref` | `40901` (`0x9FC5`) | `S16`, `0.1Pn%` | Whole percentages `-100..100`. Negative charges; positive discharges; zero stops the forced reference. A nonzero write first sets `40907 = 4`. |
| `number.pylontech_h3x_bridge_charge_limit_soc` | `40902` (`0x9FC6`) | `U16`, `%` | `50..100%`. |
| `number.pylontech_h3x_bridge_discharge_limit_soc_eps` | `40903` (`0x9FC7`) | `U16`, `%` | `5..100%`; manufacturer EPS discharge limit. |
| `select.pylontech_h3x_bridge_ems_mode` | `40907` (`0x9FCB`) | `U16` enum | `0` Self-Consumption, `1` Back up, `2` Off-Grid, `3` Feed in priority, `4` User, `5` PN-Customer. |

| `switch.pylontech_h3x_bridge_heat_pump` | `40848` (`0x9F90`) | `U16` boolean | Writes `0` or `1`. This is the inverter's heat-pump control flag, not a generic external heat-pump relay. |
| `switch.pylontech_h3x_bridge_period_1` | `40908` (`0x9FCC`) | `U16` boolean | Enables/disables time slot 1. |
| `switch.pylontech_h3x_bridge_period_2` | `40914` (`0x9FD2`) | `U16` boolean | Enables/disables time slot 2. |
| `switch.pylontech_h3x_bridge_period_3` | `40920` (`0x9FD8`) | `U16` boolean | Enables/disables time slot 3. |
| `switch.pylontech_h3x_bridge_period_4` | `40926` (`0x9FDE`) | `U16` boolean | Enables/disables time slot 4. |

Register `40400` (`0x9DD0`, `U16`) is read with the export limit to preserve the contiguous source block, but the current integration does not expose it as a Home Assistant entity.

### Time-Slot And Clock Registers (Slave 2)

Each of the four time slots occupies six contiguous holding registers:

| Slot | Enable | Start | End | Mode | Power | Weekday mask |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | `40908` | `40909` | `40910` | `40911` | `40912` | `40913` |
| 2 | `40914` | `40915` | `40916` | `40917` | `40918` | `40919` |
| 3 | `40920` | `40921` | `40922` | `40923` | `40924` | `40925` |
| 4 | `40926` | `40927` | `40928` | `40929` | `40930` | `40931` |

- Enable is `0` (disabled) or `1` (enabled).
- Start and end are packed as `(hour << 8) | minute`.
- Slot mode is `0` for charge or `1` for discharge.
- Slot power is `U16` in `0.1Pn%`; for example, `10%` is written as `100`.
- The services currently use weekday mask `0x7F` for every day.
- A slot is programmed atomically at integration level: disable, write registers, set EMS mode, then enable. Do not run a second Modbus client concurrently.

When clock synchronization is enabled, the integration writes:

| Register | Packed value |
| --- | --- |
| `40932` (`0x9FE4`) | Year |
| `40933` (`0x9FE5`) | `(month << 8) | day` |
| `40934` (`0x9FE6`) | `(hour << 8) | minute` |
| `40935` (`0x9FE7`) | `(second << 8) | weekday`, where Sunday is `0` |

## HACS Installation

1. In HACS, add `https://github.com/shuffleznl/h3x-bridge` as a custom repository of type **Integration**.
2. Install **Pylontech H3X Bridge**.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration**.
5. Add **Pylontech H3X Bridge** and enter the Modbus TCP IP/port.

## Manual Installation

1. Copy `custom_components/pylontech_h3x_bridge` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to **Settings > Devices & services > Add integration**.
4. Add **Pylontech H3X Bridge** and enter the Modbus TCP IP/port.

## Operational Notes

- The manufacturer protocol lists Modbus TCP endpoint `172.22.184.210:502` as the factory default. Configure the address actually assigned to the inverter; the host and port can be updated from the integration options.
- Register `40901` is written as signed `S16`: negative values charge, positive values discharge.
- Home Assistant exposes `40901` as whole percent values from `-100` to `100`; the integration converts that to the raw Modbus `0.1Pn%` signed integer.
- `Pn%` is a percentage of the inverter's rated power, not a kW command. Confirm the applicable inverter rating and start with a small magnitude while observing physical battery and grid power.
- The integration always sets EMS mode `40907` to `4` (`User mode`) before nonzero charge/discharge power writes.
- The integration uses a small raw Modbus TCP transport instead of PyModbus. Requests stay serialized on one socket, and late duplicate ACK frames are discarded until the matching transaction id is received.
- The integration performs its own locked write retries and keeps confirmation reads on the normal polling cycle.
- The BMS module count is read from ESS register `0x1436` / decimal `5174`, calculated as ESS base `0x1400` plus offset `0x0036` ("Module number in series").
- Total and usable capacity are derived from the Force H3 datasheet table for the detected module count. The derived usable capacity is checked against the 95% depth-of-discharge theoretical value and exposed with a deviation percentage.
- IP and port can be changed later from **Settings > Devices & services > Pylontech H3X Bridge > Configure**.
- Keep only one Modbus client connected to the inverter. Disable the original `pylon_fh3x` integration and other polling tools for the same H3X while using Pylontech H3X Bridge; concurrent TCP sessions can desynchronize Modbus transaction IDs.
- Firmware, grid-code, BMS, SOC, temperature, and protection interlocks can reject or suppress an otherwise valid command. Verify control writes at low power on the actual installation; a successful register read-back does not by itself prove physical charge or discharge.

## Time-Slot Services

Version `0.3.0` keeps the service-based control using the manufacturer time-slot registers and renames the Home Assistant domain to `pylontech_h3x_bridge`. These services are intended for controlled testing:

| Service | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `pylontech_h3x_bridge.force_charge_now` | Program a temporary charge slot, default slot `4`, default EMS mode `pn_customer` (`40907 = 5`). |
| `pylontech_h3x_bridge.test_force_charge_modes` | Program the same temporary charge slot first with EMS mode `5`, then with EMS mode `4`, and return measured snapshots. |
| `pylontech_h3x_bridge.clear_time_slot` | Disable one time slot. |

The slot command writes `40908-40931` style registers: disable slot, optionally sync inverter clock (`40932-40935`), write start/end/mode/power/weekday, set EMS mode, then enable the slot.
